# Note on Design

Most of the HTML and CSS used in this project was generated with the assistance of AI tools or was made by someone else and implemented with their permission. My primary focus was on backend development, authentication, and data handling. Design elements were integrated to support the functionality and improve user experience.

# Known issues/ further improvements

tables, navbar and other features do not scale well when size of the window is reduced or used on mobile
